# DONE: 1. (9 pts)
#
#   For this _todo_, reference the code below.
#
#   At each location below, indicate the values of each of these variables:
#
#       a
#       m
#       self.a
#       self.m
#       t1.a
#       t1.m
#       t2.a
#       t2.m
#
#   I have provided a comment below the code where you can indicate the values
#   of each object. If a variable is undefined, simply put an  X  .
#
#   Feel free to include some print statements to help you with this problem if
#   you think it would be helpful.
#
#   I will do one of these in class so you know how I would like you to
#   indicate your answers.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
